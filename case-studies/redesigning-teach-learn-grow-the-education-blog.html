          <h3 class="case-study-heading">Background</h3>
          <p class="body-copy">Teach.Learn.Grow. the education blog serves as a key channel for thought leadership, product education, and brand storytelling. After rebuilding the CMS used for the main website, we hadn’t yet been able to give this property the same attention. With this update, we wanted to bring this property up to the same standards as the main website, avoid disrupting the current content management workflow, and apply a design refresh/redesign in alignment with current branding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-approach row">
          <div class="copy-block fade-in">
            <h3 class="case-study-heading">Approach</h3>
            <p class="body-copy">For users, we wanted to clearly present relevant content while keeping the experience consistent with other branded web properties. For content editors, the goal was to minimize disruption to their existing workflow, which already met most of their needs. To address this, we rebuilt the experience around a component library and restructured the way content was organized and displayed.</p>

              <img src="../img/cs-2-comps.png" alt="Case Study 2">
            </div>
            <p class="case-study-image-caption">New components were designed and built for this project. We used Figma as a way to collaborate on these designs and create documentation to hand off to developers to build.</p>


            <p class="body-copy">The redesign focused on clarity, consistency and brand alignment. Updated taxonomies created a stronger hierarchy, helping users navigate categories and discover related posts more easily. Integrating the component library visually aligned the blog with the main website and up-to-date with current design patterns and branding.</p>

            <p class="body-copy">Alongside the implementation of our component library, we were able to bring the blog up to date on current interaction tracking strategies used on other main web properties. So while the breadth of available performance data may have been limited, we built the foundation necessary to more accurately measure performance and analyze user behavior moving forward.</p>
